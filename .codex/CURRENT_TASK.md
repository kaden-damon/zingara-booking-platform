# Meta Pixel & Conversions API Integration

STATUS: APPLICATION RELEASED - TOKEN ACCEPTED; TEST-EVENT DELIVERY PROOF PENDING

DATE: 3 NOVEMBER 2026

## Objective

Complete the existing consent-gated Meta Pixel and verified PayFast Purchase
Conversions API integration without duplicating the Phase 56.1 outbox or
affecting booking and payment workflows.

## Verified Baseline

- Meta Pixel already records PageView, ViewContent, InitiateCheckout and
  AddPaymentInfo only after Marketing consent and never on Admin routes.
- Phase 56.1 already provides ITN-authoritative payment-level Purchase events,
  an atomic destination outbox, bounded retries, leases and idempotency.
- Production initially had 357 consented attribution records and 299 successful GA4
  Purchase deliveries. No Meta outbox rows or historical Meta backlog exist.
- `META_PIXEL_ID` and `META_CAPI_ACCESS_TOKEN` are present as Production-only
  Vercel secrets. Their values were not exposed.
- Global server Purchase authority and attribution capture are active. Meta is
  not yet an enabled destination.

## Implementation

- Use the server-provided `META_PIXEL_ID` for both browser Pixel and CAPI instead
  of a duplicated source-code constant.
- Keep the CAPI access token server-only and send it in the Authorization header,
  never in source, browser bundles, URLs, logs or records.
- Default to supported Graph API `v26.0`, while retaining an optional validated
  environment override.
- Keep Purchase server-only when the Phase 56.1 server path is authorised. Each
  verified PayFast deposit, balance or full payment uses its own stable payment
  event ID and actual ZAR transaction value.
- Add a management-only readiness endpoint with two deliberately separate checks:
  a passive token identity check and an optional synthetic Test Events delivery
  check. Dataset delivery is never inferred from unrelated object-read access.

## Verification

- Focused advertising and consent tests: 27/27 passed.
- Final provider-readiness regression tests: 12/12 passed.
- TypeScript passed.
- Changed-file ESLint passed.
- Diff validation passed.
- The local full build reached an existing compiler-worker restriction in three
  unrelated Admin files. Vercel's clean Production build remains the release
  gate; no failure referenced changed Meta files.

## Production Release

- Application commits: `84f9ba441ce15993b3222bf1e7285b4fe0390eed`,
  `cef67e910988dd137cdb8bfd80563cd76acb960d` and
  `c6c2caf19e31a24ab3639eb65f0e9faba30b0e22`. Follow-up commit
  `59e63b0dedd4299b62d22f239a2f56d97731671b` adds only sanitised provider
  error reporting to the protected readiness check.
- Vercel automatically redeployed the corrected Production secret as deployment
  `9WYg3HZTR3MrmhYCi2tRq3U4C55Y`, Ready on 3 November 2026 at 08:21:15 SAST.
  Follow-up deployment `94SwdXrVC19XyhYV4PSx1dq8B57S` reached Ready at
  08:26:29 SAST and is the active Production release.
- Authenticated Production Admin loaded successfully. The management-only
  readiness request reached Meta without exposing credentials or sending an
  event.
- The protected retest used the corrected Production secret and Meta rejected
  the configured dataset/token readiness lookup with HTTP 400, provider code
  100, null subcode, type `OAuthException` and sanitised message
  `(#100) Missing Permission`. The failure is permission-related; dataset
  identity and provider acceptance therefore remain unverified.
- Production now contains 301 successful GA4 deliveries and still contains zero
  Meta outbox rows.

## Permission Error Resolution

- The HTTP 400 `OAuthException` code 100 `(#100) Missing Permission` came from
  `GET /v26.0/{dataset_id}?fields=id`. That operation tests dataset-object read
  access, not the `POST /v26.0/{dataset_id}/events` operation used by CAPI.
- Commit `8ee27acf6cd2792ffcd438217ea7dcb06404e37a` replaces that false gate with
  `GET /v26.0/me?fields=id` for passive token authentication and an optional
  synthetic, non-Purchase Test Events POST for actual delivery proof.
- Production deployment `dpl_DHSfS6PtdspULodkuUNf45W7jz32` was Ready and
  aliased to `book.zingara.co.za` on 3 November 2026 at 08:44:58 SAST.
- Authenticated Production verification returned HTTP 200 with
  `tokenAccepted=true`, `deliveryVerified=false`, `datasetMatches=null` and
  `testEventRequired=true`. The existing token is active; dataset delivery has
  not yet been tested because no `META_CAPI_TEST_EVENT_CODE` is configured.
- Production contains 304 successful GA4 outbox rows and zero Meta rows. No
  Purchase, synthetic event or historical conversion was queued or sent by
  this correction.

## Safe Activation Boundary

- Meta CAPI remains disabled. No activation timestamp was set and no historical
  or current Purchase was sent to Meta.
- No replacement token or permission change is justified by the former GET
  failure. Jurelle only needs to provide a Test Events code for the configured
  dataset so the protected POST check can prove delivery without a Purchase.
- Enable Meta only with a new UTC activation timestamp after provider acceptance
  succeeds. Payments before that timestamp must never be queued.
- Do not send fabricated Purchase events or replay historical payments.
- A Meta Test Events code is still required if an Events Manager test-event
  receipt is required; no fabricated Purchase test was sent.
